# List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussList and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well. Each description should be at least 1 paragraph with two to five sentences.


1. **Javascript Variables** - the functions of Javascript Variables are pretty easy to memorize and understand how they work since some are quite similar to each other. In addition, we use variables in every task and quiz we do so it got easier to use overtime.
2. **Data Types** - the concept of different values took some time but I eventually got the hang of it. Especially after not doing well in a data type segment of a quiz, and studying the topic more intensely, I got the hang of determining data types more quickly.
3. **Comparison Operators** - comparison operators were very similar to those used in C++, so I was very familiar with using them effectively. Many of the practices I did for the long test also contained many Comparison Operators, so the additional knowledge helped me understand how to use them efficiently.
4. **Logical Operators** - similarly, the logical operators were very similar to those used in C++, so I was quick in using them efficiently. Most of the practices we had also used many Logical Operators, so it was easy to get the hang of using them.
5. **For Loops** - similarly, for loops were very similar to those used in C++, so it was quite easy to understand how to use them efficiently. Since for loops was a topic I struggled in during Grade 8, I focused on it more, so I have a lot of experience in using For Loops.


# List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but needs further practice/discussion and why.  The why should be per topic listed. 
1. **While Loops** - after LT 2, I feel like the idea on while loops and how it does not have a specific number of interations before stopping is clear, but I struggle in using while loops in the practical coding segment. I also am used to using for loops instead and did not spend much time practicing while loops.
2. **Do While Loops** - after LT 2, I feel like I already grasped the concept on how it works, but struggle with using do while loops. I usually am used to for loops rather than do while loops as well.
3. **Number Properties** - it is somewhat difficult to memorize when to use which Number() property and there were not many practices nor coding tasks on using them. I also struggle on when I should use parseInt() and parseFloat() as I found the change in data types somewhat confusing.
4. **Declaring Functions** - I struggled quite frequently in using functions, even when we were using C++. Even after many practices and discussions on Functions, I cannot quite grasp how declaring them in different ways besides using "function functionName() {}".
5. **Printing Function Output** - I sometimes got confused on how to print the output of functions, and the difference between "return" and "console.log". I need more help in printing values and returning values from C++.


# Describe on what will be your plan of action in order to help yourself in understanding further the topics listed on the second items.


1. I will set up more time slots in my schedule to hone my skills in practicing the topics I listed. 
2. I will focus more on practical coding rather than conceptual and theoretical questions since I struggle more in practical coding. 
3. I will make sure to avoid using a cheat sheet or checking materials in answering practical questions too.


# In the activities that were done in class, list at least two that you think were effective and at least two that you think not effective in helping you understand topics in our course and why? 

## Effective
1. **Speed Tests** - it allowed competition and a good basis for where I am in my coding journey- from my skills, to analytical thinking, to speed in practical coding. Especially since it was not graded and even gave bonus points, it was very fun to compete against classmates in each table.
2. **All Graded Tasks** - they allowed us to practice coding and further enhance our understanding for different coding topics. It also gave us sample coding problems that we could use to practice for the LTs.

## Not Effective
1. **Diagnostic Exam** - while it helped us understand and know how good we were in coding, it was quite stressful since it was graded. Especially since it used C++, and the way functions are used in JavaScript are a bit different from C++, it did not really help in preparing for using JavaScript as well.
2. **Quizzes** - While some were relatively easy and gave many tries to answer, it was stressful since it was also graded. It was a bit hard to solve some of the questions since I was relatively new to JavaScript at the time, and even with prior knowledge, it was still somewhat daunting to solve the quizzes.
